# Postcards

I came across the mod [Contact](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/contact) in a Youtube video, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever!

I wanted to try to remake the postcard feature of it as a plugin since that was my favorite part of seeing the mod in action! I'll be intermittently working on this project just to try to see how accurate I can get it to the mod.

Earlier versions will use JSON for storage, but I plan to explore more storage options.

## Planned Releases
### Release v0.1 - The Basics
Release v0.1 will have papers which will be "postcards" that can be written on and viewed in chat.

### Release v0.2 - The Visuals
Release v0.2 will introduce postcard textures that will replace the papers. It will also introduce custom crafting for each postcard texture.

### Release v1.0 - Full Release
This will be the full release in which postcards can be written on and viewed from a textured GUI.
